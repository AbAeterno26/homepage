## Introduction
This Fan Page was made and ranked by Sarah Blok. I am currently a student enrolled at the University of Amsterdam. This page was created for the sole purpose of a minor in programming. The goal was to demonstrate the usage of HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Git. 

## Requirements
A browser that is able to open the HTML files.

## Usage
To start off, simply open the homepage folder and select index.html. This is the homepage of the website. From here you can navigate to any topic by clicking the buttons. Have fun exploring!
